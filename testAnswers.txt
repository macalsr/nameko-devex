✓ Question 1: Why is performance degrading as the test run longer?
    Answer: The performance degradation during extended test runs is primarily dye to the services practices
    of loading substantial amounts of data without implementing essential optimizations such as pagination and caching.
    These two crucial elements are vital for efficient data retrieval and management, reducing the strain on resources
    and improving overall service responsiveness

✓ Question 2: How do you fix it?
    Answer : I addressed the performance degradation issue by implementing the following key solutions:
    ✓ Added pagination to methods that load significant amounts of data. This ensures that data is retrieved in manageable chunks,
    reducing memory consumption and enhancing efficiency.
    ✓ Introduced a cache to the methods responsible for querying data from both PostgresSQL and Redis. Caching minimizes the need
    for repetitive data retrieval, resulting in faster response times and reduced resources usage. These optimizations collectively
    improved service performance during prolonged test runs.
